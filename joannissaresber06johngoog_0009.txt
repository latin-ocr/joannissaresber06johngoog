PREFACE.

NaxrtohisEpistolary writings, the most important
work of our authoris his Polycraticus, contained in
this and the following volumea. The full title of the
work is Ponrcaarrcos, siue de erupis Curiatium et
vestigiis pbilosophorum.

Polycraticus was chosen, for the etymology of that
word gives no indication whatever of the nature or
subject of his work. The treatise is divided into

this work was completed in 1156, though it may have
been written at different times before that date, and
revised by its author at a later period.

It has been often printed, after collation with
different MSS. F or the present edition the text has
